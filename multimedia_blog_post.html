                    <p> "Beekeeping plays a huge roll in pollinating our food. If bees were eliminated from the planet would people perish in 4 years??

Or when a bee stings you they mark you with an alarm pheromone that draws more bees to sting you. Does the queen bee control how the colony behaves? Do bees feed small hive beetles? Can a dead honey bee still sting you?" </p>
